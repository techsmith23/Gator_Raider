- This is a project that I have done while attending The University Of Florida, in which I was instructed to use the Java Programming Language to create an attack controller for Ms. Pac-Man

- This repo contains the project description, in addition to my overall summary that includes the design of how the attack controller is running in the program, in addition to my source code
